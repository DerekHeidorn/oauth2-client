<p>Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular v2 and above") is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.</p>
